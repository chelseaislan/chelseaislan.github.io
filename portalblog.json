      "blogP1": "The Handmaid's Tale certainly makes good on the harrowing image that concluded last week's episode — the effort of Fred and Serena to get Nichole back into Gilead has only escalated since that first PSA. They've even temporarily relocated to Washington, D.C., in order to continue in their mission and bring the Canadians to the table.",
      "blogP2": "Fred is directing more broadcasts to bring international attention to his Nicole effort. Lydia organizes the handmaids in the studio, lining them up while Fred serves as director. June and Serena get a moment alone where the former tries appealing to the latter's sense. “How many more of these videos is he going to do?” June asks. “As many as it takes,” Serena responds.",

      "blogP3": "It's been a bad few episodes for June and Serena, but here The Handmaid's Tale sets the stage for their ugliest interaction in the show's history. And where better to have this conversation take place than in front of a decapitated Lincoln Memorial?"

      "blogP1": "The narrative of The Handmaid's Tale includes two types of marriages, the marriages that are arranged by the regime of Gilead, which is exemplified through the marriage of the Commander and his Wife, and the love-based marriages that existed before the Gilead regime came into power, this type of marriage includes Offred's former marriage to Luke.",
      "blogP2": "By having the Handmaids obtain the names “of” followed by the name of their Commander, it does not only highlight the fact that they are someone's possession, it also connects to the idea of De Beauvoir that women are always compared to men, as a woman “is nothing other than what man decides”. This is further incorporated in The Handmaid's Tale, as the women are either the men's Handmaids or their Wives. Even though the Wives are allowed to keep their own names, unlike the Handmaids, they are still only who they are compared to their husbands.",

      "blogP3": "Though Gilead is a dystopia and does not represent an actual Western society, Atwood herself has said that “she would not put anything in the book “that hasn't already been done in some form or another, that isn't happening now or for which we don't have the technology” (as quoted in Howells et all., 97). The Gileadean idea that women are intended or designed to produce children and that marriage is used in order to reassure reproduction comes from reality."
